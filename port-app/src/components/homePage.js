        I am from Virginia Beach, Va and have lived here all my life. I received a Dual Major degree in Finance and Accounting at Old Dominion University and have worked for non-for-profits as an accountant prior to programming. However, I was always interested in technology and computers and in (Month Year you started Lambda) I enrolled in <a  class= "text-blue-700 underline" href="https://lambdaschool.com/">Lambda School</a>to further develop my skills in coding and programming. 
        </p>
        <p class = "bio mt-2">
        Lambda School was a fully immersive, highly intensive 9-month program where I completed hundreds of hours of code and built five fully functional web applications. I mastered my HTML, JavaScript, Python and CSS  skills as well as the <a  class= "text-blue-700 underline" href="#skills">skills listed below.</a> In addition to the technical skills, I also expanded my ability to build fully functional web applications on fully remote teams.

        <p class = "bio mt-2">When I am not programming, I like to go kayaking, skiing, going to the beach, and hanging with friends and family.</p>
