        I am from Virginia Beach, Va and lived here all my life. I got  a Dual Major degree in Finance and Accounting at Old Dominion University. During my last year at the university I got an internship at a non for profit organization as an accountant . I did not enjoy the work because it was the same boring task everyday and I felt like I had made the wrong career choice. It did not feel like I was learning new things everyday or explaining my knowledge. My fallback plan was to find a career in programming because I was always interested in technology and computers. Once I learned about lambda school from my brother, I decided to try it out.
        </p>
        <p class = "bio mt-2">
        Lambda school seemed imitating and I did struggle to get through the program because I had no programming experience. I was able to complete the course and it was a great experience. I learned most of the tools to build full functioning web apps and the tools listed below. Lambda does a good job improving your social skills with requiring zoom meetings everyday with your groups.  When I am not on the computer, I like to go kayaking, skiing, going to the beach, and hanging with friends and family.
